I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey and thus am 
always determined to learn various new technologies! At this point, I am
very familiar with most of the AI and DL concepts. I have worked on 2 
Deep learning projects and am trying to get into more of the intresting ones!
I am also a frontend web development enthusiast. I am quite familiar with all 
basic terminologies. I am learning the ReactJS framework right now! I do have 
some experience in backend too, I have worked on a mini project in which I 
used the Flask framework!

I am still a learner, and am looking for new oppurtunities to work in! Please
contact me if you feel like I could assist you! Thanks!
